        content: |
          As a Data Analytics Engineer, my main focus was to improve workflow efficiency and automation of reports. I achieved this by introducing new methods for auto monitoring and restarting tasks/jobs in case of system failures. I'm particularly proud of this innovation, as it significantly improved productivity for the team. Additionally, I had the opportunity to work as a GeoSpatial Data Scientist, where I delivered a few network coverage projects from scratch. These projects were essential to improving the company's infrastructure. Overall, my work demonstrated my expertise in both data analytics and spatial analysis, as well as my ability to implement innovative solutions that increased efficiency and productivity.

          - Improved ML model prediction of Active Customers for next fiscal month with 99% recall and precision.
          - Developed pip library for statistics department (nurtelecom-gras-library) that assisted majority pro jects.
          - Developed a Telegram bot for managing scheduled tasks (on-demand start and stop) that vastly improved and simplified managing and monitoring work for the entire department.
          - Developed neural network-based time-series forecasting of Active Customersâ€™ numbers in Python (TensorFlow) with visualisation in Tableau.
          - Became one of the best employees (Q4 2022) for developing progressive reporting systems and automating processes..
