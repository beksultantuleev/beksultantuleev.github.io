          As a Data Scientist / Data Automation Engineer, my main focus was 
          to improve workflow efficiency and automation of reports. I achieved this by introducing 
          new methods for auto monitoring and restarting tasks/jobs in case of system failures. 
          I'm particularly proud of this innovation, as it significantly improved productivity for the team. 
          
          Additionally, I had the opportunity to work as a GeoSpatial Data Scientist, 
          where I delivered a few network coverage projects from scratch. 
          These projects were essential to improving the company's infrastructure. 
          Overall, my work demonstrated my expertise in both data analytics and spatial analysis, 
          as well as my ability to implement innovative solutions that increased efficiency and productivity.

          - Trained multiple models with high performance and incorporated automatic feature selection every month to ensure optimal performance.
          - Identified customers likely to reduce activity two weeks earlier, providing valuable insights to the marketing department.
          - Created an opportunity to improve customer retention and increase revenue for the company.
          - Developed a Python library for streamlined connection to Oracle databases, enabling efficient retrieval and upload of both regular and spatial data.
          - Developed a Telegram bot to streamline task and job management in Oracle, reducing the time and effort required for maintenance and control of these processes.
          - Implemented automatic failure recovery, which allows failed tasks to be automatically restarted in the event of external failures, improving system reliability and reducing downtime.
          - Contributed to increased productivity and efficiency within the department by providing an accessible and user-friendly interface for managing complex processes.
          - Developed time-series forecasting of Active Customers’ numbers in Python (TensorFlow) with visualisation in Tableau.
          - Became one of the best employees (Q4 2022) for developing progressive reporting systems and automating processes.

          As a Data Scientist Intern, I have been working on developing MultiOutput ML models to predict customers with a high likelihood of purchasing protection products in different income segments. Through my work, I have also created a custom framework that enables the operation of multiple models and generates embedded reports upon completion. This framework simplifies further ML applications and helps to streamline the entire process.

          Overall, my work has been focused on creating predictive models that can provide valuable insights into customer behavior and preferences, and help to identify potential areas for growth and expansion. By leveraging the power of data and machine learning, I have been able to develop models that can accurately predict customer behavior and help to inform strategic decision-making.

          - Developed and trained multi-output models to predict customers' likelihood of purchasing protection products.
          - Created a separate model for each offered protection product and segmented it based on earning groups.
          - Achieved great results that were very helpful for the marketing team.
          - Generated reports with necessary graphs and analysis to showcase the findings.

      - title: Plants watering automation
        content:  This project involves an automated plant watering system using an MCU ESP8266 with Wi-Fi capabilities. The system utilizes MQTT for communication and a moisture sensor to monitor soil humidity levels. When the sensor detects low moisture, it automatically triggers watering, ensuring optimal soil conditions for plant growth. This setup allows for remote monitoring and control, enhancing efficiency and convenience in plant care.

      - title: Visualization of Reference Signal Received Power in Tableau
        content: The project visualizes signal strength data obtained from NetMAX using Tableau, a powerful data visualization software. By representing the average signal strength or RSRP (Reference Signal Received Power) of each point on a map, the project enables users to easily identify areas with poor signal coverage. With this information, network operators can take the necessary steps to improve the quality of their network coverage in these areas, ultimately leading to a better user experience for their customers. Overall, the project offers a simple and effective solution for analyzing and optimizing network coverage.

      - title: Visualization of Subscribers by Settlement
        content: The project involved visualizing subscribers in Tableau by location or settlement, and providing information about the revenue generated by the company each month for each settlement. The main objective of the project was to provide the company with insights into the distribution of subscribers and revenue across different settlements, helping them to identify areas of high revenue and potential growth opportunities. The visualization created in Tableau was an effective tool for presenting this information in a clear and concise manner, making it easy for the company to identify patterns and trends. By visualizing the data in this way, the company was able to make informed decisions about where to focus their resources and marketing efforts, and how to maximize revenue across different settlements.

      - title: Visualization of Active Cutomers' migration in Tableau
        content: The project involved visualizing the migration path of active customers for a network operator using Tableau. The main objective of the project was to demonstrate the migration pattern of customers each month. By analyzing the migration path, the network operator could gain valuable insights into customer behavior and patterns, which could then be used to improve their services and marketing strategies. The visualization created in Tableau was an effective tool for presenting the migration pattern in a clear and concise manner, making it easy for the network operator to understand and take appropriate action.

      - title: LOS/NLOS detection and mitigation 
        content: This project used an Ultra-Wideband (UWB) system to improve indoor positioning accuracy by training a machine learning model to detect Non-Line-Of-Sight (NLOS) signals caused by obstacles like walls and furniture. The model was a neural network that could identify NLOS signals, and was combined with filters that conditionally ignore NLOS measurements. The project's findings could improve location-based services in various domains like healthcare, retail, and logistics.

      - title: Application of Ultra-Wideband System in Unmanned Areal Vehicle (UAV)
        content: The system provides an application of Ultra-Wideband (UWB) technology to unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for accurate positioning in indoor environments. The project utilized a Kalman filter to combine the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) of the UAV with an external UWB tag, ensuring centimeter-level accuracy for indoor aerial handling. By providing precise positioning, the UWB system enabled small UAVs or mini drones to perform complex tasks with greater accuracy, enhancing their capabilities in indoor environments.
